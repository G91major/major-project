# Smart Vision: Advanced Video Object Segmentation and Detection for Dynamic Environments

## 🔍 Project Overview
**Smart Vision** is an advanced computer vision system that detects and tracks objects in dynamic environments without relying on YOLO. This project focuses on **full-body detection** and **motion tracking** to analyze human movement patterns. Future improvements include **segmentation** to identify objects at a pixel level.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Real-time full-body detection** using **HOG+SVM & Background Subtraction**  
✅ **Multi-object tracking** with **Stable ID Assignment**  
✅ **Motion-based detection** to detect moving objects accurately  
✅ **Optimized for real-time performance**  
✅ **Future-ready** for **segmentation & abnormal gait detection**
